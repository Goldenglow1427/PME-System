## Package Message Editor System

<p align="right"><em>Oct. 3, 2022: By Victor Chen</em></p>

This is a system for creating a message to inform the owner of packages everyday in *Almost Everyone* group chat.

### User Guide

After you get into the system, you need to directly input the name of owners in lines.

When you're finished, input "-1" as the ending signal. A sample input is attached below.

```tex
Gene Forrester
Finny
Constantine XI Palaiologos
Chtholly Nota Seniorious
Mr. Carpenter

```

And then the program will send out an output of the message and also copy to your clipboard if you're using Windows system.

Sample message if you input the names above will be like below.

```tex
Packages arrived today: Chtholly Nota Seniorious, Constantine XI Palaiologos, Finny, Gene Forrester, Mr. Carpenter

```
